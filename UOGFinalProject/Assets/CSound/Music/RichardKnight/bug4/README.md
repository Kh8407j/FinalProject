# Debugger - Unfixed Bugs Volume 1

## Overview
Unfixed Bugs is a series of pieces of music by the artist Debugger, which may take the form of a traditional album, but solely feature compositions created using textual programming languages. The pieces are presented as open-source code and do not use any binary supporting files (such as PCM samples, analysis data etc). Hence Unfixed Bugs projects are fully readable, open-source musical works which describe both sound and arrangement. The compiled audio may be made available for release elsewhere. 

Aesthetically the project aims to represent the general approach to experimental techno music consistent with other output by Debugger, and exploit generative possibilities provided by defining musical structure with code.



## Composition Notes

### BUG4 (2021) 
Utilises the BID loop arrangement format created in BUG3 and computed during realtime playback. Designed to be a lightly glitchy, relatively downtempo minimal techno type piece.
