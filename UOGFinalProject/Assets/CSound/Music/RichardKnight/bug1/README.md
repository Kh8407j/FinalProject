# Debugger - Unfixed Bugs Volume 1

## Overview
Unfixed Bugs is a series of pieces of music by the artist Debugger, which may take the form of a traditional album, but solely feature compositions created using textual programming languages. The pieces are presented as open-source code and do not use any binary supporting files (such as PCM samples, analysis data etc). Hence Unfixed Bugs projects are fully readable, open-source musical works which describe both sound and arrangement. The compiled audio may be made available for release elsewhere. 

Aesthetically the project aims to represent the general approach to experimental techno music consistent with other output by Debugger, and exploit generative possibilities provided by defining musical structure with code.



## Composition Notes

### BUG1 (2019-2020)
This is the first completed work in the series and uses preset arrays defining the frequencies of two chords. FM synthesis is used quite extensively and the sequencing is done in a set of conditional statements. The arrangement is computed at initialisation time.
